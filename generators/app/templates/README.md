<!--
Welcome to your new proposal repository. This document will serve as the introduction and 
 strawman for your proposal.

The repository is broken down into the following layout:

  /README.md        # intro/strawman (this file)
  /LICENSE          # ECMA compatible license (BSD-3 Clause)
  /src              # ecmarkup sources for the specification
  /docs             # ecmarkup output

To build the specification, run:

  npm run compile

To preview the specification, run:

  npm run start

It is recommended that you configure GitHub Pages in your GitHub repository to point to the
'/docs' directory after you push these changes to 'master'. That way the specification text
will be updated automatically when you publish.
